# Contents

* [bin](bin): Collection of scripts globally available in the system.
* [config](config): User configuration for applications which is symlinked, used for complex configurations (like EWW) or assets.
* [hosts](hosts): Per host configuration / module enablement.
* [installation](installation): Partitioning / install scripts for a ZFS install. (ext4 not covered, refer to the NixOS manual)
* [modules](modules): Modules for everything that can be specifically enabled or disabled.
* [packages](packages): Custom packages for stuff not available in nixpkgs.

Modules are used for everything to make it as modular as possible, with some enabled by default. Home mananger configuration is not separate however, thus required.

These configs were written without any prior Nix experience and I've taken a lot from existing configs to create mine.

I thank all these people for sharing their configurations for me to learn from!
